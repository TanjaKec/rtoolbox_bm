## RStudio's layout 

When you open RStudio for the first time it will be split into three sections. Each section has its own tab with shortcuts for the relevant options available from the main RStudio menu.

- The tall <span style="color:red">**red section**</span>  on the left is the <span style="color:red">Console</span> and thatâ€™s where you can type in R code to execute.
This code is also called commands or functions.

- In the <span style="color:#00B2EE">**top right section**</span>, thereâ€™s the <span style="color:#00B2EE">Environment</span> tab where you can see the data you are currently working on. At first this section is empty because you have not loaded any data yet.

- In the <span style="color:#FF00FF">**bottom right section**</span> there are tabs to flip through the <span style="color:#FF00FF">Files</span> and folder structure of your computer (like in Finder or Explorer), <span style="color:#FF00FF">Help</span> information etc.
